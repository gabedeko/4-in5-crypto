                    <p class="row-two-body">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation. </p>

                    <p class="row-three-body">A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks.</p>

                <h2>What's The Big Deal?</h2>
                <p class="row-four-body">The hype around crypto has given the world a sense of possible change in the global market which many are slowly starting to believe is necessary. Even though the foundation, infrastucture, and theories behind the technology are far from perfect, it has inspired ideas that could be very promising for future economies even if they don't necessarily rely on any of the existing cryptocurrencies. Now that it's been established that there are plausible alternatives to what is currently standardized, societies can think outside of the box in terms of how to manage economies.</p>
